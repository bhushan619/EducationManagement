                    <p>coursekatta is map based educational search engine with profiles of educational institutions, hobby classes, extra curricular activities trainers & passionate teachers across India. We started our organization with the vision to make education more accessible & easily reachable for everyone. When we were students & thinking about choosing career opportunities we faced many issues & never got knowledge about what actually market needs. So we followed what others said which landed up many of us into facing issues related to getting dream career. We realised there should be someone who can guide, mentor & nurture the knowledge about market demands & update us the changes required. So coursekatta came in existence. On coursekatta you can search required education details, compare them, see for future projection & market opportunities. Which will help you in taking decision. So keep exploring the opportunities near you..</p>
